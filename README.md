## How to Locally Use Clear
- Clone the GitHub Repository locally in your preferred editor
- Open Terminal either in the editor, or on your computer and navigate to your current working directory (these instructions assume you already have Python 3 installed and configured)
    - Run 'python manage.py migrate'
    - Install the required modules using 'pip install -r requirements.txt
    - Now you are ready to run the code! In Terminal still, you can run 'python manage.py runserver'
